PART 1.
i.e. word examples
word1 = "functionality"
word2 = "apple"
word3 = "orange"

Create a class funtion that has the following functionality (as methods):

1. Takes a word as input
2. counts the vowels of a given word vowels: "aeiou"
3. counts the consonants of a given word "all the other letters that are not vowels"
4. Add tests using unittest

EXTRA:
Implement a way to read each word from  a text file.


PART 2.

Revist the code from yesterday for WordInfo (or use your own version)
Modify the code to do the following:

1. instead of reading one word, it reads a text file of words
2. implement a method called get_word_frequency() that counts the frequency of the words in the text
3. implement tests using pytest
